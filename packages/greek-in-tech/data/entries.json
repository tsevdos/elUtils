Titan is also the name of the prototype of the Atlas 2 computer developed by Ferranti and the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in Cambridge, England. Facebook also gave the name Titan to it's modern messaging system unveiled in 2010.",

The term is often used when the term byte might be ambiguous, as historically there was no standard definition for the size of the byte. Octets are used in the representation of Internet Protocol computer network addresses.",

    "description": "Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It was first introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics. Lambda calculus is a universal model of computation equivalent to a Turing machine (Church-Turing thesis, 1937). Its namesake, Greek letter lambda (λ), is used in lambda terms (also called lambda expressions) to denote binding a variable in a function. Lambda calculus may be typed and untyped. In typed lambda calculus functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input's \"type\" of data. Lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics and computer science. Lambda calculus has played an important role in the development of the theory of programming languages. Functional programming languages implement the lambda calculus. Lambda calculus also is a current research topic in Category theory.",
